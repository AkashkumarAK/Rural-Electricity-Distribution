# Rural-Electricity-Distribution
#### This is a DSA project to maximize the number of houses that can be electrified and minimize the cost of laying wires in the village

## Problem Definition
#### The Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) scheme for village electrification and providing electricity distribution aims to provide every household with an electricity supply. There is a power generation house that supplies power to the grid. The grid further supplies power to different parts of the village through electric wires connected to electricity poles. The pole distributes electric supply to houses and industries connected to it. 20 percent of the power generated by the powerhouse is reserved for industries using 3-phase current and the rest of the power is supplied to other parts of the village. Find a solution to maximize the number of houses that can be electrified and minimize the cost of laying wires in the village. Also, find the power supplied to industries and power left for 2 phase supply in the village.

## Project Plan
#### 1.We will use Kruskal’s algorithm to minimise the cost of implementation of wires in the village and to connect the grid to the electricity poles.

#### 2.We will be using Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between the electricity pole and the houses connected to it.

#### 3. will use Knapsack  problem algorithm to maximise the number of houses that can be electrified.
